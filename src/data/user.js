In this game you can choose 1 of 2 characters to play, the goal is to survive as long as possible while 3 different types of mobs will spawn on either side of you at random. The mobs speed will be randomized as well as the time between spawns.",

			description:
				"During a computer engineering course I completed an octal calculator on an FPGA. I utilized logic gates and verilog to construct it. After completing the addition component I integrated it into the main component and did testing. I did this for each operation: subtraction, multiplication, and division. The numbers were displayed on the seven segment displays and different switches were used to change the two numbers being operated on. I do not have any images or videos of this project. ",
