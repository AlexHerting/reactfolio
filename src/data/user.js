				"Online store that was made with a react frontend and a node backend while utilizing mongo db for the database. The app uses GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to function. Users can create an account as well as login, add items to a shopping cart, view items, rate items, delete items from the site, search for items, as well as create their own items.",

				"Personal project that I did in Unity 2D. This program uses lots of C# for making scripts as well as using sprite sheets for the animations of the characters. In this game you can choose 1 of 2 characters to play, the goal is to survive as long as possible while 3 different types of mobs will spawn on either side of you at random. The mobs speed will be randomized as well as the time between spawns.",

			description:
				"During a computer engineering course I completed an octal calculator on an FPGA. I utilized logic gates and verilog to construct it. After completing the addition component I integrated it into the main component and did testing. I did this for each operation: subtraction, multiplication, and division. The numbers were displayed on the seven segment displays and different switches were used to change the two numbers being operated on. I do not have any images or videos of this project. ",

			title: "Pokémon Rogue Type Game",
			description:
				"This is a rogue type game that was developed in C for 6 weeks and then ported to C++ where it was finished. The game mimics the popular game Pokémon, the official Pokémon database is used to create the Pokémon in this game. The user picks a starting pokemon and takes on different NPC's along the way. Each NPC with its own movement mechanics and rules as well as randomized Pokémon in their inventory. The player can also catch wild pokemon in certain terrains while they adventure around the 400 x 400 map. Each section is 1 of the thousands of sections that are each randomly generated and stored in memory as they are created. The game is made to be user friendly and easy to follow along. This is by far the most complex project I have completed and I learned a tremendous amount of new programming techniques along the way.",
